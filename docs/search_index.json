Miguel de Cervantes from Don Quixote 4.1 General Goals Distributions Sampling from distributions Sampling distribution of the mean Sampling statistics (statistics of many samples) Central limit theorem Normal Distribution z-scores 4.2 R This is one of two special labs where we dont use too much real data. We will mostly fake everything. Yes, you will learn how to fake data in this course. Be a superhero, and only use these skills for good and not for evil. As we progress through the course, you will learn that generating simulated data can be very useful to help you understand real data. In fact, I will say this right now. If you cant simulate the data you expect to find, then you probably cant understand the data that you do find very well. Thats a bold statement. Its probably partly true. 4.2.1 Generating Numbers in R There are many ways to make R generate numbers for you. In all cases you define how the numbers are generated. Well go through a few of the many ways. 4.2.1.1 sample The sample function is like an endless gumball machine. You put the gumballs inside with different properties, say As and Bs, and then you let sample endlessly take gumballs out. Check it out: gumballs &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) sample_of_gumballs &lt;-sample(gumballs, 10, replace=TRUE) sample_of_gumballs ## [1] &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; Here the sample function randomly picks A or B each time. We set it do this 10 times, so our sample has 10 things in it. We set replace=TRUE so that after each sample, we put the item back into the gumball machine and start again. Heres another example with numbers some_numbers &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5) sample_of_numbers &lt;-sample(some_numbers, 20, replace=TRUE) sample_of_numbers ## [1] 4 5 4 5 5 1 5 2 5 5 5 5 3 3 4 3 5 5 3 3 Lets do one more thing with sample. Lets sample 1000 times from our some_numbers variable, and then look at the histogram library(ggplot2) some_numbers &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5) sample_of_numbers &lt;-sample(some_numbers, 1000, replace=TRUE) hist(sample_of_numbers) We are looking at lots of samples from our little gumball machine of numbers. We put more 5s in, and voila, more 5s come out of in our big sample of 1000. 4.2.1.2 runif uniform distribution We can sample random numbers between any range using the runif(n, min=0, max = 1) function for the uniform distribution. We discussed this in the textbook. A uniform distribution is flat, and all the numbers between the min and max should occur roughly equally frequently. Lets take 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1 and plot the histogram. Well just do it all in one line for speed. hist(runif(1000,0,1)) This is histogram is flattish. Not perfectly flat, after all we only took 1000 samples. What if we took many more, say 10,000 total samples? Now it looks more flat, each bin is occurring about 500 times each, which is pretty close to the same amount. hist(runif(10000,0,1)) 4.2.1.3 rbinom the binomial distribution The binomial distribution sounds like a scary word binomial (AAGGGGHHHHH, stay away!). The binomial can be a coin flipping distribution. You use rbinom(n, size, prob). n gives the number of samples you want to take. Well keep size = 1 for now, its the number of trials (forget this for now, its more useful for more complicated things than what we are doing, if you want to know what it does, try it out, and see if you figure it out). prob is a little list you make of probabilities, that define how often certain things happen. For example, consider flipping a coin. It will be heads or tails, and the coin, if it is fair, should have a 50% chance of being heads or tails. Heres how we flip a coin 10 times using rbinom. coin_flips &lt;- rbinom(10,1,.5) coin_flips ## [1] 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 We get a bunch of 0s, and 1s. We can pretend 0 = tails, and 1 = heads. Great, now we can do coin flipping if we want. For example, if you flip 10 coins, how many heads do you get? We can can do the above again, and then sum(coin_flips). All the 1s are heads, so it will work out. coin_flips &lt;- rbinom(10,1,.5) sum(coin_flips) ## [1] 6 Alright, so we get the sum, which tells us the number of heads. But, should we always get that number of heads if we flipped a coin 10 times? If you keep redoing the above, youll get different answers. 5 heads will be the most frequent answer, but you will get lots of other answers too. Hold on to your seats for this next one. With R, we can simulate the flipping of a coin 10 times (you already know that, you just did it), and we can do that over and over as many times as we want. For example, we could do it 100 times over, saving the number of heads for each set of 10 flips. Then we could look at the distribution of those sums. That would tell us about the range of things that can happen when we flip a coin 10 times. We can do that in loop like this: save_number_of_heads&lt;-length(1000) # make an empty variable to save things in for(i in 1:1000){ save_number_of_heads[i] &lt;- sum(rbinom(10,1,.5)) } hist(save_number_of_heads) See, that wasnt too painful. Now we see another histogram. The histogram shows us the frequency observing different numbers of heads (for 10 flips) across the 1000 simulations. 5 happens the most, but 2 happens sometimes, and so does 8. All of the possibilities seem to happen sometimes, some more than others. 4.2.1.4 rnorm the normal distribution Well quickly show how to use rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=1) to sample numbers from a normal distribution. And, then well come back to the normal distribution later, because it is so important. hist(rnorm(10000,0,1)) There it is, a bell-shaped normal distribution with a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1. Youve probably seen things like this before. Now you can sample numbers from normal distributions with any mean or standard deviation, just by changing those parts of the rnorm function. 4.2.1.5 mixing it up The r functions are like Legos, you can put them together and come up with different things. What if wanted to sample from a distribution that looked like a two-humped camels back? Just sample from rnorm twice like this mix away. hist( c( rnorm(100,25,5), rnorm(100,50,5)) ) 4.2.1.6 summary You can generate as many numbers as your computer can handle with R. PSA: Dont ask R to generate a bajillion numbers or it will explode (or more likely just crash, probably wont explode, thats a metaphor). 4.2.2 sampling distribution of the mean. Remember the sampling distribution of the sample means from the textbook? Now, you will see the R code that made the graphs from before. As weve seen, we can take samples from distributions in R. We can take as many as we want. We can set our sample-size to be anything we want. And, we can take multiple samples of the same size as many times as we want. 4.2.2.1 Taking multiple samples of the same size Lets take 10 samples from a normal distribution (mean = 0, and SD = 1). Lets set the sample-size for each to be 20. Then, well put them all in a data frame and look at 10 different histograms, one for each sample. scores &lt;- rnorm(10*20,0,1) samples &lt;- rep(1:10,each=20) my_df &lt;- data.frame(samples,scores) First, look at the new my_df data frame. You can see there is a column with numbers 1 to 10, these are the sample names. There are also 20 scores for each in the scores column. Lets make histograms for each sample, so we can see what all of the samples look like: ggplot(my_df, aes(x=scores))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ facet_wrap(~samples)+ theme_classic() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Notice, all of the samples do not have the same looking histogram. This is because of random sampling error. All of the samples are coming from the same normal distributions, but random chance makes each sample a little bit different (e.g., you dont always get 5 heads and 5 tails when you flip a coin right) 4.2.2.2 Getting the means of the samples Now, lets look at the means of the samples, we will use dplyr to get the means for each sample, and put them in a table: library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union sample_means &lt;- my_df %&gt;% group_by(samples) %&gt;% summarise(means=mean(scores)) knitr::kable(sample_means) samples means 1 -0.2177895 2 -0.0812509 3 -0.1068242 4 0.1052023 5 -0.2714919 6 -0.1945682 7 0.0957661 8 -0.2051711 9 -0.4245270 10 0.0809232 So, those are the means of our samples. What should the means be? Well, we would hope they are estimating the mean of the distribution they came from, which was 0. Notice, the numbers are all not 0, but they are kind of close to 0. 4.2.2.3 histogram for the means of the samples What if we now plot these 10 means (of each of the samples) in their own distribution? ggplot(sample_means, aes(x=means))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. That is the distribution of the sample means. It doesnt look like much eh? Thats because we only took 10 samples right. Notice one more thingWhat is the mean of our 10 sample means? This is a mean of means. Remember that. mean(sample_means$means) ## [1] -0.1219731 Well, thats pretty close to zero. Which is good. When we average over our samples, they better estimate the mean of the distribution they came from. 4.2.2.4 simulating the distribution of sample means Our histogram with 10 sample means looked kind of sad. Lets give it some more friends. How about we repeat our little sampling experiment 1000 times. ExplainWe take 1000 samples. Each sample takes 20 scores from a normal distribution (mean=0, SD=1). Then we find the means of each sample (giving us 1000 sample means). Then, we plot that distribution. # get 1000 samples with 20 scores each scores &lt;- rnorm(1000*20,0,1) samples &lt;- rep(1:1000,each=20) my_df &lt;- data.frame(samples,scores) # get the means of the samples sample_means &lt;- my_df %&gt;% group_by(samples) %&gt;% summarise(means=mean(scores)) # make a histogram ggplot(sample_means, aes(x=means))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. There, that looks more like a sampling distribution of the sample means. Notice its properties. It is centered on 0, which tells us that sample means are mostly around zero. It is also bell-shaped, like the normal distribution it came from. It is also quite narrow. The numbers on the x-axis dont go much past -.5 to +.5. We will use things like the sampling distribution of the mean to make inferences about what chance can do in your data later on in this course. 4.2.3 Sampling distributions for any statistic Just for fun here are some different sampling distributions for different statistics. We will take a normal distribution with mean = 100, and standard deviation =20. Then, well take lots of samples with n = 50 (50 observations per sample). Well save all of the sample statistics, then plot their histograms. We do the sample means, standard deviations, maximum values, and medians. Lets do it. all_df&lt;-data.frame() for(i in 1:1000){ sample&lt;-rnorm(50,100,20) sample_mean&lt;-mean(sample) sample_sd&lt;-sd(sample) sample_max&lt;-max(sample) sample_median&lt;-median(sample) t_df&lt;-data.frame(i,sample_mean,sample_sd,sample_max,sample_median) all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df) } library(ggpubr) a&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_mean))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic() b&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_sd))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic() c&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_max))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic() d&lt;-ggplot(all_df,aes(x=sample_median))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;)+ theme_classic() ggarrange(a,b,c,d, ncol = 2, nrow = 2) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. From reading the textbook and attending lecture, you should be able to start thinking about why these sampling statistic distributions might be usefulFor now, just know that you can make a sampling statistic for pretty much anything in R, just by simulating the process of sampling, measuring the statistic, doing it over a bunch, and then plotting the histogram. This gives you a pretty good estimate of the distribution for that sampling statistic. 4.2.4 Central limit theorem We have been building you up for the central limit theorem, described in the textbook and in class. The central limit theorem is basically that the distribution of sample means will be a normal curve. We already saw that before. But, the interesting thing about it, is that the distribution of your sample means will be normal, even if the distribution the samples came from is not normal. Huh what? To demonstrate this the next bit of code is modified from what we did earlier. We create 100 samples. Each sample has 1000 observations. All of them come from a uniform distribution between 0 to 1. This means all of the numbers between 0 and 1 should occur equally frequently. Below I plot histograms for the first 10 samples (out of the 100 total, 100 is too many to look at). Notice the histograms are not normal, they are roughly flat. scores &lt;- runif(100*1000,0,1) samples &lt;- rep(1:100,each=1000) my_df &lt;- data.frame(samples,scores) ggplot(my_df[1:(10*1000),], aes(x=scores))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;, bins=10)+ facet_wrap(~samples)+ theme_classic()+ ylim(0,200) We took samples from a flat uniform distribution, and the samples themselves look like that same flat distribution. HOWEVER, if we now do the next step, and compute the means of each of our 100 samples, we could then look at the sampling distribution of the sample means. Lets do that: sample_means &lt;- my_df %&gt;% group_by(samples) %&gt;% summarise(means=mean(scores)) # make a histogram ggplot(sample_means, aes(x=means))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;, bins=15)+ theme_classic() As you can see, the sampling distribution of the sample means is not flat. Its shaped kind of normal-ish. If we had taken many more samples, found their means, and then looked at a histogram, it would become even more normal looking. Because thats what happens according to the central limit theorem. 4.2.5 The normal distribution Why does any of this matter, why are we doing this, can we stop now!!!!!! PLEEEEAASSEE, somebody HELP. We are basically just repeating what was said in the textbook, and the lecture, so that you get the concept explained in a bunch of different ways. It will sink in. The reason the central limit theorem is important, is because researchers often take many samples, then analyse the means of their samples. Thats what they do. An experiment might have 20 people. You might take 20 measurements from each person. Thats taking 20 samples. Then, because we know that samples are noisy. We take the means of the samples. So, what researchers are often looking at, (and you too, very soon) are means of samples. Not just the samples. And, now we know that means of samples (if we had a lot of samples), look like they are distributed normally (the central limit theorem says the should be). We can use this knowledge. If we learn a little bit more about normal distributions, and how they behave and work, we can take that and use it to understand our sample means better. This will become more clear as head into the topic of statistical inference next week. This is all a build up for that. To continue the build-up we now look at some more properties of the normal distribution. 4.2.5.1 Graphing the normal distribution Wait, I thought we already did that. We sort of did. We sampled numbers and made histograms that looked like normal distributions. But, a normal distribution is more of an abstract idea. It looks like this in the abstract: normal_dist &lt;- dnorm(seq(-4,4,.1), 0, 1) values &lt;-seq(-4,4,.1) normal_df &lt;-data.frame(values,normal_dist) ggplot(normal_df, aes(x=values,y=normal_dist))+ geom_line()+ theme_classic() A really nice shaped bell-like thing. This normal distribution has a mean of 0, and standard deviation of 1. The heights of the lines tell you roughly how likely each value is. Notice, it is centered on 0 (most likely that numbers from this distribution will be near 0), and it goes down as numbers get bigger or smaller (so bigger or smaller numbers get less likely). There is a range to it. Notice the values dont go much beyond -4 and +4. This because those values dont happen very often. Theoretically any value could happen, but really big or small values have really low probabilities. 4.2.5.2 calculating the probability of specific ranges. We can use R to tell us about the probability of getting numbers in a certain range. For example, when you think about. It should be obvious that you have a 50% probability of getting the number 0 or greater. Half of the distribution is 0 or greater, so you have a 50% probability. We can use the pnorm function to confirm this: pnorm(0, mean = 0, sd= 1, lower.tail=FALSE) ## [1] 0.5 Agreed, pnorm tells us the probability of getting 0 or greater is .5. Well, what is the probability of getting a 2 or greater? Thats a bit harder to judge, obviously less than 50%. Use R like this to find out: pnorm(2, mean = 0, sd= 1, lower.tail=FALSE) ## [1] 0.02275013 The probability of getting a 2 or greater is .0227 (not very probable) What is the probability of getting a score between -1 and 1? ps&lt;-pnorm(c(-1,1), mean = 0, sd= 1, lower.tail=FALSE) ps[1]-ps[2] ## [1] 0.6826895 About 68%. About 68% of all the numbers would be between -1 and 1. So naturally, about 34% of the numbers would be between 0 and 1. Notice, we are just getting a feeling for this, youll see why in a bit when we do z-scores (some of you may realize we are already doing that) What about the numbers between 1 and 2? ps&lt;-pnorm(c(1,2), mean = 0, sd= 1, lower.tail=FALSE) ps[1]-ps[2] ## [1] 0.1359051 About 13.5% of numbers fall in that range, not much. How about between 2 and 3? ps&lt;-pnorm(c(2,3), mean = 0, sd= 1, lower.tail=FALSE) ps[1]-ps[2] ## [1] 0.02140023 Again a very small amount, only 2.1 % of the numbers, not a a lot. 4.2.5.3 summary pnorm You can always use pnorm to figure how the probabilities of getting certain values from any normal distribution. Thats great. 4.2.6 z-scores We just spent a bunch of time looking at a very special normal distribution, the one where the mean = 0, and the standard deviation = 1. Then we got a little bit comfortable with what those numbers mean. 0 happens a lot. Numbers between -1 and 1 happen a lot. Numbers bigger or smaller than 1 also happen fairly often, but less often. Number bigger than 2 dont happen a lot, numbers bigger than 3 dont happen hardly at all. We can use this knowledge for our convenience. Often, we are not dealing with numbers exactly like these. For example, someone might say, I got a number, its 550. It came from a distribution with mean = 600, and standard deviation = 25. So, does 545 happen a lot or not? The numbers dont tell you right away. If we were talking about our handy distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1, and I told I got a number 4.5 from that distribution. You would automatically know that 4.5 doesnt happen a lot. Right? Right! z-scores are a way of transforming one set of numbers into our neato normal distribution, with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. Heres a simple example, like what we said in the textbook. If you have a normal distribution with mean = 550, and standard deviation 25, then how far from the mean is the number 575? Its a whole 25 away (550+25 = 575). How many standard deviations is that? Its 1 whole standard deviation. So does a number like 575 happen a lot? Well, based on what you know about normal distributions, 1 standard deviation of the mean isnt that far, and it does happen fairly often. This is what we are doing here. 4.2.6.1 Calculating z-scores get some numbers some_numbers &lt;- rnorm(20,50,25) Calculate the mean and standard deviation my_mean &lt;- mean(some_numbers) my_sd &lt;-sd(some_numbers) print(my_mean) ## [1] 51.23319 print(my_sd) ## [1] 18.70485 subtract the mean from your numbers differences&lt;-some_numbers-my_mean print(differences) ## [1] 15.649678 3.192527 -2.034483 -4.297526 -13.434642 -17.485569 ## [7] 7.824633 4.218616 -16.135693 -22.304624 1.799175 12.195580 ## [13] -15.978305 1.282799 18.156784 -8.331856 -17.702987 -21.254827 ## [19] 55.866825 18.773894 divide by the standard deviation z_scores&lt;-differences/my_sd print(z_scores) ## [1] 0.83666397 0.17067907 -0.10876762 -0.22975458 -0.71824362 -0.93481447 ## [7] 0.41832099 0.22553589 -0.86264735 -1.19245109 0.09618761 0.65200078 ## [13] -0.85423304 0.06858107 0.97069904 -0.44543818 -0.94643810 -1.13632679 ## [19] 2.98675542 1.00369102 Done. Now you have converted your original numbers into what we call standardized scores. They are standardized to have the same properties (assumed properties) as a normal distribution with mean = 0, and SD = 1. You could look at each of your original scores, and try to figure out if they are likely or unlikely numbers. But, if you make them into z-scores, then you can tell right away. Numbers close to 0 happen a lot, bigger numbers closer to 1 happen less often, but still fairly often, and numbers bigger than 2 or 3 hardly happen at all. 4.2.7 Generalization Exercise (1 point - Pass/Fail) Complete the generalization exercise described in your R Markdown document for this lab.
